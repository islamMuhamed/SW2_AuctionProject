__**Online Auction System**__
The **online auction system** may work as follows: Each participant should
register with the system so he can subscribe to any auction session.
During any auction session an item is open for bids placed by the session participants,
for simplicity assume only one auctioned item per session.
The system notifies the bidders with the starting of the auction session;
bidders can obtain the latest status and submit their bids. At the end of
the session the system notifies the winner and announces the result to
the other participant bidders.

    1- Membership manamgement.
    2- Bid management.
    3- Inventory management.
    4- Billing and invoices.
